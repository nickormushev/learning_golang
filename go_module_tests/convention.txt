Methods should have the structure be named with the first letter of the structure name.
func (c Circle) () {

}

2) 
I should be consistent about writing methods either as *Circle or Circle. It does not matter if I want
to change the value of the variable or not. This is strange considering that someone might tamper and knowing
private and public conventions from c++ and java

3) 
It might be a good idea to put helper functions in seperate functions outside of the main test classes so a person can focus on the 
tests and not on the helpers


4)

5)
Package names should be short concise and only single word with lower case letters
